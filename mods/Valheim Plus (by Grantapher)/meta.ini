The mod includes several different main features that allow users to modify the stats of players, buildings and entities. V+ also offers players the ability to build and place objects with very high precision through a sophisticated system, as well as tweaking and modifying already placed objects with equal precision. The goal is to provide V+ as a base modification for Valheim to increase quality of life, tweak the game's difficulty, and in general, improve the player's experience. V+ also comes with a version and configuration control system for servers and users, enabling server owners to ensure that only players with the same configuration are able to join the server.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]All features can be enabled and tweaked through the V+ config file.[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b]Player[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br
