nexusDescription="[size=6][b]PlanBuild[/b][/size]\n<br />PlanBuild enables you to plan, copy and share your building creations in Valheim with ease. The mod adds two new tools to the game. The [b]Plan Hammer[/b] is used to plan your creations before actually gathering all the materials. When you are happy with your build, you can add the required building materials one by one or use a custom totem to automatically build the pieces for you. The [b]Blueprint Rune[/b] lets you copy, save or delete your creations as a single building piece which can also be shared with other players using the mod and also includes terrain modification tools for quick and more precise terraforming without using the Hoe or Cultivator.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Planning[/b][/size]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/PlanMode.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Introducing a new item, the [b]Plan Hammer[/b], which can be crafted from a single log of [b]wood[/b] and the blessing of Odin shining upon you.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuildUnity/Assets/PlanBuild/Icons/plan_hammer.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Plan the construction of pieces without the need to gather the resources first. Anyone can add the required resources to the planned structure later and finish the construction after it was placed.\n<br />\n<br />The [b]Plan Hammer[/b] is compatible with custom piece tables from other mods. All custom pieces will be incorporated into the runes table for the planned pieces. You still need a [b]Hammer[/b] and the required crafting station to finish the construction.\n<br />\n<br />Planned pieces that are [b]unsupported[/b] can not be finished. These pieces are also slightly more transparent so you can see what is and isn't supported. The planned pieces themselves do not require support, so you can build forever (if you can reach far enough).\n<br />\n<br />Real pieces also snap to the planned pieces, so you could even use them as [b]spacers[/b] or [b]rulers[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Plan Totem[/b][/size]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/PlanTotem.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Build a [b]Plan Totem[/b] near your planned structures to be able to add resources in a centralized location for all individual pieces on the plan.\n<br />\n<br />It will also protect existing structures. Any piece that is destroyed [u](not removed by the Hammer)[/u] will be replaced with a plan for that same piece in the same place!\n<br />\n<br />This needs to be built with the vanilla Hammer tool and costs you [b]1 Wood[/b] and [b]1 Grey Dwarf Eye[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Skuld Crystal[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuildUnity/Assets/PlanBuild/Icons/plan_crystal.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Includes the [b]Skuld Crystal[/b], a wearable item that removes the shader effect from the blueprints, so you can see what the construction will look like when completed.\n<br />\n<br />Create it from a single [b]Grey Dwarf Eye[/b].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Watch your step![/b] The pieces are still not really there, and will not support you!\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Blueprinting[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/BlueprintMode.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Introducing a new item, the [b]Blueprint Rune[/b], which can be crafted from a single [b]stone[/b] and festering willpower given to you by the gods.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuildUnity/Assets/Blueprints/Icons/BlueprintRuneIcon.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Copy existing structures into [b]Blueprints[/b] and rebuild them as planned or regular pieces all at once. The blueprints are saved in and loaded from the filesystem as [b].blueprint[/b] files. Also supports [b].vbuild[/b] files (you can load and build your BuildShare saves with this mod)! After switching to the blueprint mode, the piece table of the Blueprint Rune offers three different categories:\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Tools[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/BlueprintTools.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />The Blueprint Rune comes with a handful of tools to handle blueprint creation and terraforming.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Create new blueprint[/b]: Directly create a blueprint from a selection indicated by the circle marker.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Ctrl[/b] to highlight all pieces which will be saved into the blueprint\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Alt[/b] and click to include vanilla snap points in your blueprint (without it only snap point markers are converted to snap points)\n<br />[*]Use the [b]Scroll Wheel[/b] to change the selection radius\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Add to selection[/b]: Add pieces to the current selection. Currently selected pieces will be highlighted in green. Per default only the hovered piece will be added to the selection. You can use various modifiers to change that behaviour.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Press [b]Q[/b] to quickly switch to the \"Remove from selection\" tool\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Alt[/b] and click to add all connected pieces. This uses a flood fill to find connected pieces.\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Ctrl[/b] and click to add pieces in a radius\n<br />[*]Use the [b]Scroll Wheel[/b] while holding [b]Ctrl[/b] to change the selection radius\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Shift[/b] and click once to define a \"starting piece\" and click again on another piece to select every piece in between those two.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Remove from selection[/b]: Remove pieces from the current selection. Currently selected pieces will be highlighted in green.  Per default only the hovered piece will be removed from the selection. You can use various modifiers to change that behaviour.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Press [b]Q[/b] to quickly switch to the \"Add to selection\" tool\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Alt[/b] and click to remove all connected pieces. This uses a flood fill to find connected pieces.\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Ctrl[/b] and click to remove pieces in a radius\n<br />[*]Use the [b]Scroll Wheel[/b] while holding [b]Ctrl[/b] to change the selection radius\n<br />[*]Hold [b]Shift[/b]  and click to clear the current selection\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Edit selection[/b]: Left click to open a menu. From here you can choose what to do with your current selection:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Copy[/b]: Make a temporary blueprint of your current selection. It will copy all pieces in the selection into a new building piece and automatically select that piece for you to build. The copy is also saved into the \"Clipboard\" category of the rune for you to access until you log out from the current world.\n<br />[*][b]Cut[/b]: Make a temporary blueprint of your current selection and delete all pieces in the current selection. The copy is also saved into the \"Clipboard\" category of the rune for you to access until you log out from the current world.\n<br />[*][b]Save[/b]: Save the current selection as a new blueprint into the file system. Opens up a new GUI window where you can enter Name, Category and Description of the blueprint. These blueprints are kept between game sessions and can also be used in the marketplace and shared with other players.\n<br />[*][b]Copy with vanilla snap points[/b]: Make a temporary blueprint of your current selection which also includes all vanilla snap points of the pieces selected.\n<br />[*][b]Cut with vanilla snap points[/b]: Make a temporary blueprint of your current selection and delete all pieces in the current selection including all vanilla snap points of the pieces selected.\n<br />[*][b]Save with vanilla snap points[/b]: Save the current selection as a new blueprint into the file system including all vanilla snap points.\n<br />[*][b]Delete[/b]: Delete all pieces in the current selection. This removes all the pieces without refunding the building materials.\n<br />[*][b]Cancel[/b]: Exit the menu without any action.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Snap point marker:[/b] Add snap point markers to all points you want to have as snap points in your blueprint. The rotation of the markers does not matter, only the center point. We highly suggest that you also use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1504]Snap points made easy[/url]ï»¿ so you can cycle through the snap points when placing the blueprint. [b]Note[/b]: You have to select the marker piece in order to capture it in the blueprint. Markers placed while having an active selection will automatically be added to that selection.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Use [b]Remove[/b] to delete a placed marker again (just like you would delete a piece with the hammer).\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Center point marker:[/b] Add a center point marker to your blueprint to determine the center of the blueprint. This is where it will be anchored while placing it. If a blueprint does not have a center point marker, a bottom corner of the blueprint is found and used as the center. [b]Note[/b]: You have to select the marker piece in order to capture it in the blueprint. Markers placed while having an active selection will automatically be added to that selection.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Use [b]Remove[/b] to delete a placed marker again (just like you would delete a piece with the hammer).\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Terrain modification marker:[/b] Add terrain mod markers to your blueprint. When the blueprint is built, the terrain is leveled to the position of that marker. [b]Note[/b]: You have to select the marker piece in order to capture it in the blueprint. Markers placed while having an active selection will automatically be added to that selection. You can interact with those markers to set various options of the terrain modification:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Shape[/b]: Set a circle or square shape.\n<br />[*][b]Radius[/b]: Radius of the terrain mod operation.\n<br />[*][b]Rotation[/b]: Rotation of the marker (only makes sense on the square marker).\n<br />[*][b]Smooth[/b]: Add smoothing to the edges of the terrain modification.\n<br />[*][b]Paint[/b]: Optionally set a new \"paint\" (Grass, Dirt, etc) to the ground when modifying the terrain.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Remove planned pieces:[/b] Delete planned pieces again. Per default only the hovered piece will be deleted. But you can use various modifiers to change that behaviour.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Press [b]Ctrl[/b] to delete plans in a radius, can be used to clean up after using it to measure distances, or as a general cleanup tool. Resources that were already added to the unfinished plans will be refunded.\n<br />[*]Use the [b]Scroll Wheel[/b] while holding [b]Ctrl[/b] to change the deletion radius.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Terrain Tools:[/b] Allows you to \"flatten\" the terrain in a chosen radius or remove previously made modifications. Uses Valheim's TerrainCompiler and is 100% compatible with the vanilla game and modifications made with the Hoe for example.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Press [b]Q[/b] to switch between a circle and a square shaped marker.\n<br />[*]Press [b]Ctrl[/b] to add smooth edges to the flattened area\n<br />[*]Press [b]Alt[/b] to remove terrain modifications.\n<br />[*]Use the [b]Scroll Wheel[/b] to change the tool radius.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Ctrl + Scroll[/b] to rotate the square marker.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Alt + Scroll[/b] to move the marker on the Y-axis.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Delete Objects:[/b] Allows you to remove vegetation objects in a chosen radius.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Press [b]Ctrl[/b] to remove all objects including Pieces and Items ([b]Warning:[/b] Very destructive).\n<br />[*]Use the [b]Scroll Wheel[/b] to change the tool radius.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][*][b]Paint terrain:[/b] Allows you to reset the terrain \"paint\" per biome (grass in the Meadows, sand at beaches, etc). Can also paint dirt or paved onto every terrain. Can be used as a \"brush\" by holding down the Attack button continously.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Press [b]Q[/b] to switch between a circle and a square shaped marker.\n<br />[*]Press [b]Ctrl[/b] to paint \"dirt\".\n<br />[*]Press [b]Alt[/b] to paint \"paved\".\n<br />[*]Use the [b]Scroll Wheel[/b] to change the tool radius.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Ctrl + Scroll[/b] to rotate the square marker.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[/list][/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Clipboard[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/BlueprintClipboard.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />You can find all of the temporary blueprints you make using the \"Copy\" command of the \"Edit Selection\" tool here. These are reset on every logout.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Blueprints[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/BlueprintBlueprints.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Place a blueprint as planned pieces. Select your previously saved blueprint and place it anywhere in the world. This works just like any other vanilla building piece. Additionally there are some extra controls to make placing your structures exactly as you want them as easy as possible:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Use [b]Scroll[/b] to rotate the blueprint.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Ctrl + Scroll[/b] to move the blueprint on the Z-axis.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Alt + Scroll[/b] to move the blueprint on the X-axis.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Ctrl + Alt + Scroll[/b] to move the blueprint on the Y-axis.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Q[/b] to reset the offset on all axes.\n<br />[*]Use [b]Shift + Scroll[/b] to adjust the camera distance.\n<br />[*]There is a (server enforced) config option to allow placing the blueprints as regular pieces, so you can configure per server if you want to allow \"cheating\" structures without resources. When enabled, build your structures without building costs by pressing [b]Ctrl[/b] while placing the blueprint. Admins are always allowed to \"direct build\". You can change the default building behaviour in the config file.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Undo/Redo[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />The Blueprint Rune features an undo/redo mechanic for most of its actions. Placed blueprints, terrain/paint modifications and object deletions can be reversed using the [b]bp.undo[/b] console command. A reversed action can also be replayed using the [b]bp.redo[/b] console command. For easy access we recommend binding those commands to a key of your liking. To bind those commands to your mouse's \"back\" and \"forth\" keys for example type this into the game's console:\n<br />\n<br />[code]bind mouse3 bp.undo\n<br />bind mouse4 bp.redo\n<br />[/code]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Blueprint Marketplace[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/BlueprintMarket.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Manage and share your blueprints through a custom GUI added to the game. Per default the marketplace is accessible via [b]End[/b] key. Rename your local blueprints, assign a Category for them (which will create a new tab on your Blueprint rune for those blueprints) or add a description to them. If a server has this feature enabled, upload your local blueprints to that server so others can download and build your creations as well. Players with admin rights on a server can also manage the server side list through that interface.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Marketplace Pieces[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sirskunkalot/PlanBuild/master/PlanBuild/resources/BlueprintPieces.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />You can place one of two new rune themed pieces in the world which provide access to your own blueprints and the market on the server. If you want to completely stop clients from accessing the server blueprints via Hotkey, there is a server enforced config which disables that Hotkey for all clients.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Installing[/size][/b]\n<br />It is recommended to use a mod manager to install PlanBuild and all of its dependencies.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to install it manually, load all of these mods as they are all required for PlanBuild to function and install them according to their respective install instructions:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim]BepInExPack for Valheim[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/HookGenPatcher]HookGenPatcher[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn]JÃ¶tunn, the Valheim Library[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />Finally extract [i]all[/i] of the contents of the PlanBuild mod archive into [pre]&lt;Valheim&gt;&#92;BepInEx&#92;plugins&#92;PlanBuild[/pre]\n<br />\n<br />It is possible for clients not using PlanBuild to connect to a server using it. Those clients won't see any planned pieces but are still able to play. You can not connect to a server without PlanBuild when the mod is installed on your local game for griefing reasons.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/b]\n<br />Fully compatible with:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/226]Build Camera[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/40]Craft from Containers[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1136]ValheimRAFT[/url] (partial compat, blueprinting does not work)\n<br />[*][url=https://github.com/redseiko/ValheimMods/releases/tag/ComfyGizmo-v1.3.0]ComfyGizmo[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />The Hammer's PieceTable is scanned automatically, mods that add Pieces should be compatible. If you find a mod that adds pieces to the Hammer and they don't show up, please post a bug report with a link to the mod or join the [url=https://discord.gg/DdUt6g7gyA]JÃ¶tunn Discord[/url] and ping [pre]@Jules[/pre] or [pre]@MarcoPogo[/pre].\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5]Configuration[/size][/b]\n<br />A lot aspects of this mod are configurable either through the config file found in your game folder ([pre]&lt;Valheim&gt;&#92;BepInEx&#92;configs&#92;marcopogo.PlanBuild.cfg[/pre]) or using the [url=https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager]BepInEx ConfigurationManager[/url]:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Server Settings[/b] (enforced on all clients connecting to a server)\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Allow blueprint rune[/b]: Allow usage of blueprint rune for clients connecting to the server.
