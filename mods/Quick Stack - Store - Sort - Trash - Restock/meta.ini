nexusDescription="[size=3]This mod attempts to be the one stop inventory management mod, combining various features into one cohesive package, while adding UI elements in addition to hotkeys as well as compatibility for Equipment and Quick Slot mods and localization.[/size]\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[/size][size=3]This mod allows you to\n<br />[/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]quickly stack your items into the current or nearby chests[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]quickly restock the items you want (like food and ammo) from the current or nearby chests[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]store all items into the current chest (complementary to the 'take all' button)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]sort the player inventory or the current chest by configurable criteria[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]trash the currently held item or quick trash all previously trash flagged items in the player inventory[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=3]All these features are controlled by the option to favorite items or slots similar to games like Terraria.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]There is also an extensive configuration system, that applies changes immediately. I highly recommend using an in-game Configuration Manager mod like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/740]this one[/url]﻿ or [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/]this one[/url]. I put a lot of effort into the descriptions of the config options, so if you have any questions, please read them.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]1 - Favoriting[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />Favoriting is the main draw to combine all these features into one mod. By holding the Favoriting Key (default: Alt) you can left click on an item to favorite it, or right click to favorite the slot it is in. This prevents most features of this mod from affecting it. No accidental quick stacking, sorting, storing or trashing. The favoriting state is shown with a custom colored border around the slot.\n<br />\n<br />If you are actively using Favoriting, I recommend changing the config option 'OverrideHotkeyBarBehavior' in the 'General' section from 'NeverAffectHotkeyBar' to 'UseIndividualConfigOptions'.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/3667/images/2094/2094-1671547317-763384465.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]2.1 - Quick Stacking[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />You are probably already familiar with Quick Stacking. With one button press, every non favorited item possible is put into the current or nearby chests that already contain this kind of item.\n<br />\n<br />This implementation is based on the original [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/29]Quick Stack[/url] mod by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/52080261]damnsneaker[/url], who gave me permission. This mod has a smarter algorithm for accessing multiple containers than the original (even if it's not threaded like [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/2049]Quicker Stack[/url], but that prevents the issues that mod is currently facing).\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/3667/images/2094/2094-1676165723-1103038310.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]2.2 - Restocking[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />Restocking is like Quick Stacking but in reverse. Quickly refill your arrows, your food or your one emergency stack of wood from the current or nearby chests. With one button press, restocking tops off (or optionally partially refills) the stack size for each item in your inventory that you want to restock, which can easily be configured (for example based on item type or favoriting status).\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/3667/images/2094/2094-1676165735-78653556.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]2.3 - Area Quick Stacking and Restocking[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />This mod uses improved checks for multiplayer compared to most Quick Stack mods, so you can't quick stack into or restock out of chests that are currently opened by someone else. Still, this mod cannot wait for network requests when blocking chests as in use (then everyone would need the mod installed), so it does have its limitations, especially with high latency. The ship container has even been excluded from area stacking as a precaution, as lots of players open and close it in rapid succession while they wait for their friends to set sail.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to get rid of those limitations, this mod is compatible with the mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1766]Multi User Chest[/url]. If you are not using it, then area quick stacking and restocking in multiplayer is disabled by default, but you can simply enable the config setting 'AllowAreaStackingInMultiplayerWithoutMUC' if you are comfortable with it.\n<br />\n<br />All area quick stacking and restocking config settings are also server synced, but it is not required for every user to have the mod installed.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]3 - Store and Take All[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />This simply adds a 'Store All' button to the chest overlay which stores all non favorited items (it can even store and unequip equipped items if you configure it that way).\n<br />\n<br />The logic of the 'Take All' button of chests (excluding tomb stones for compatibility) was also updated to work complementary and symmetrically to 'Store All'.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]4 - Sorting[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />Sorting is based on the popular mod [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/end360/InventorySorting/]Inventory Sorting[/url] by [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/end360/]end360[/url]﻿ (with permission). It adds a 'sort inventory' and 'sort container' button that respects favoriting.\n<br />\n<br />There are various different sort criteria to choose from:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]category (bunches up similar item types into categories like armor, weapons, etc)\n<br />[*]internal name\n<br />[*]translated name\n<br />[*]weight\n<br />[*]value\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Ties are always broken by internal name, quality and stack size. You can also sort automatically when opening the inventory or a container.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/3667/images/2094/2094-1676165848-218991172.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]5 - Trashing and Quick Trashing[/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />Trashing is based on the amazing mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/441]Trash Items[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/111195808]virtuaCode[/url]﻿ (with permission). It adds a trash can UI element to the inventory screen to quickly trash any non favorited item.\n<br />\n<br />This mod also adds Quick Trashing. By holding the Favoriting Key while you attempt to trash an item, you instead 'trash flag' this kind of item, similar to favoriting. When you click on the trash can without holding an item, an option to Quick Trash will appear allowing to trash all trash flagged items in your inventory.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/3667/images/2094/2094-1671547324-1808242402.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />If you are scared of trashing the one stack of an item that you usually consider trash flagged, consider putting it in a favorited slot.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1766]Multi User Chest[/url]:[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Due to the continued efforts of the author [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/111418768]Margmas[/url], the newest version of 'Multi User Chest' and my mod are now compatible. Be aware that sorting a container, that someone else is already using, only works if that user also has my mod installed.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=3]This mod has explicit compatibility for the following Equipment and Quick Slot mods:\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ComfyMods/ComfyQuickSlots/]Comfy Quick Slots[/url]:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]My mod will respect both the equipment slots and the quick slots, and intentionally allows restocking the quick slots. 'Take All' will put items into the quick slots though, but that is intended functionality of 'Comfy Quick Slots'.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/AzuExtendedPlayerInventory/]Azu Extended Player Inventory[/url]:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]﻿My mod will respect both the equipment slots and the quick slots, and intentionally allows restocking the quick slots. The buttons from my mod will move to not overlap if the separate equipment slot UI is enabled.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/OdinsQOL/]Odins QOL[/url] and [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/Odins Extended Inventory/]Odins Extended Inventory[/url]:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]My mod will respect both the equipment slots and the quick slots, and intentionally allows restocking the quick slots. The buttons from my mod will move to not overlap if the separate equipment slot UI is enabled.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Aedenthorn's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1356]Extended Player Inventory[/url]:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]This mod behaves identically to AzuEPI, OdinsQOL and OdinsExtendedInventory, because they used Aeden's work as a base. If you use this, be sure to download this mod from Nexus and not from Thunderstore, as those are unofficial irregularly updated versions.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />RandyKnapp's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/92]Equipment and Quick Slots[/url]:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The slots from this mod are not actual inventory slot, so my mod cannot affect them in any way (which is good). Due to that, restocking the quick slots is not possible﻿ though. The buttons from my mod will move to not overlap with the equipment slot UI and while using a chest the small Quick Stack and Restock buttons are hidden if you have quickslots enabled (because there is no room for them).\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/348]Better Archery[/url]:﻿\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]My mod will respect the slots this mod reserves for the quiver feature (all 16 of them, even if it only uses 3), and intentionally allows restocking the arrows. 'Better Archery' also changes how item adding, including 'Take All', works, so please be aware that that is not my doing.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][b]Incompatibility[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Stacks of items with custom data, like from [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/Jewelcrafting/]Jewelcrafting[/url], [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/Blacksmithing/]Blacksmithing[/url] or [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/Cooking/]Cooking[/url], are excluded from getting merged by sorting or getting restocked, but otherwise behave normally.\n<br />\n<br />The container buttons from this mod are intentionally hidden when using certain custom containers (like the jewelry bag from [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/Jewelcrafting/]Jewelcrafting[/url]), because my mod cannot affect them anyway.\n<br />\n<br />The UI from this mod is currently incompatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1413]Project AUGA[/url], but compatibility is being worked on. Hotkeys should work though.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is incompatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/441]Trash Items[/url] because it is included in this mod.\n<br />\n<br />This mod cannot detect item drawers from [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/KGvalheim/ItemDrawers/]KGvalheim's ItemDrawers[/url] (unlike the item drawers from [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/makail/ItemDrawers/]makail's ItemDrawers[/url] in the past).[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Localization[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This mod includes a translation system for all ingame display texts (not the config menu). Currently English, Chinese, Russian, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Swedish, Korean and Italian are supported.\n<br />\n<br />For minor edits, you can override any display text in the config. If you want to translate everything to your native language, you can take the 'QuickStackStore.English.json' as a template and name your file 'QuickStackStore.&lt;language&gt;.json', where '&lt;language&gt;' needs to be the [url=https://valheim-modding.github.io/Jotunn/data/localization/language-list.html]folder name of the base game for your language[/url]. When you are done or need help, please reach out to me, so I can add it to the mod for everyone.\n<br />\n<br />Thank you to everyone who provided a translation:[/size]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />The Chinese translation was provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/114839878]Tiomer[/url].\n<br />The Russian translation was provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/82796113]Opik7[/url].\n<br />The French translation was provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/45502817]cyouinlan[/url].\n<br />The Brazilian Portuguese translation was provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/37243480]kaiqueknup[/url] and updated by the YggBrasil team.\n<br />The Polish translation was provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/174267204]ViRooz[/url].\n<br />The Swedish translation was provided by [url=https://github.com/DeathDaisy]DeathDaisy[/url].\n<br />The Korean translation was provided by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/134678658]hanawa07[/url].\n<br />The Italian translation was provided by [url=https://github.com/marcowesii]Marcuz08[/url].\n<br />The Ukrainian translation was provided by [url=https://github.com/cawa-93]cawa-93[/url].[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Installation[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]This is a BepInEx mod.
