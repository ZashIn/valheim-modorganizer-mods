If you would like to see these features added, let me know in the comments here or preferably in the Github page for the mod.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Enable ServerSync to allow server admins to maintain control over the rewards earned for consuming a trophy\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4]Credits\n<br />[/size]\n<br />This mod is a fork and adaptation of the great work done by [Khairex](https://github.com/Khairex) on their original mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/123]UsefulTrophies[/url]. Given that Khairex has seemingly fallen out of activity in the Valheim community and left their mod to grow incompatible with the newer versions of the game, I have taken the liberty to fork and re-release the mod under a new name.\n<br />\n<br />Special Thanks to [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Khairex]Khairex[/url] for their original work!\n<br />\n<br />Source: [url=https://github.com/theRTC204/UsefulTrophiesAgain]Github[/url]"
