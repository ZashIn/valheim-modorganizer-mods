nexusDescription="Just zoom all the way in to go into first person mode. \n<br />\n<br />After about 4 years its updated. \n<br />\n<br />Long story short the working on the mod made me hate playing the game, I never made it out of the swamp. then about 6-7 major life events happened as well. Got back into the game about a week ago. The mod is working again and better than before. [size=5][b]IF FOR SOME REASON YOU HAVE AN OLD CONFIG FILE FROM THIS MOD DELETE IT![/b][/size], the new default settings are much better with the newer version of unity. \n<br />\n<br />I give no guarantee it will work as intended on multiplayer. Sorry I never had a good way to test it and never played multiplayer myself. I may make a few updates but no promises. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />----------------------- OLD, IGNORE \n<br />\n<br />Still a work in progress but Its pretty playable. I had fun. \n<br />\n<br />needs [url=https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/]https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/\n<br />[/url]\n<br />Vidéo d'instructions en francais dans l'onglet 'videos'\n<br />(Someone named Fabs20 made an installation video in french and sent me a message about it. Auto translation is pretty rough but understandable.) \n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Some info about this mod:\n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />The goal of this mod is to incorporate a first person view, while still retaining as much of the original feel as possible. \n<br />I think the feel of the game is great as is I just want to bring that to a first person view without changing the vision of the game. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I've added a configuration file for FOV and a couple other things. It is generated first time you run the game with the mod loaded, example at bottom of page. (located in \"...Valheim&#92;BepInEx&#92;config&#92;CameraMod.Kailen_.cfg\"\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]: after installing BepInexPack just put the CameraMod.dll in the plugins folder (in its own nested folder if you want)\n<br />...steamapps&#92;common&#92;Valheim&#92;BepInEx&#92;plugins&#92;\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]\n<br />These settings are reloaded anytime you hit the OK button on the in game settings. So you can experiment with the FOV and other settings while in game.
